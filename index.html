 <h1>Will packaging retain its current form despite the digital evolution and rapid improvement of technology, and if so what would change?</h1>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="grid-item"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height2">    <p>In my thesis I analyze packaging and packaging design, more specifically if the next generation of packaging will be digital. This subject comes from my personal fascination of packaging design. As a graphic designer I believe packaging needs just as much attention as the product you are selling. This comes in many different forms. Modern day packaging have features which go beyond just the protection and conservation of products. It also includes features to communicate, promote and act. </p>
</div>
 <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3"><p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3">    <p>Packaging supplies multiple signals to affect or perception and impact on consumer behavior. These functions are considered normal today, but it took many years to develop packaging to a carefully crafted object that merges multiple functions into a thin piece wrapped around products. Increasing competition and continuous technological innovations have formed the evolution of packaging since the 1860s.</p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2">    <p>Packaging is like a silent salesman for a product. In a supermarket, on the shelf, we as a costumers look at the product through its packaging and begin to form perceptions about the quality and its value to us. Successful packaging emotionally appeals to it’s target audience and allows them to imagine what they can do with the product. And if achieved, these emotions often convert into a decision of purchase, which is the main goal. I have come to understand that product packaging is carefully and precisely designed to go beyond its emotional appeal and to serve important functions critical to ensure that the product delivers a great experience before purchase.</p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width3">    <p>Some of the key functions are to protect, contain, preserve, communicate, promote and transact. The product is protected from physical damages caused from shock, vibration or compression during transportation, contained for efficiently and to define the amount of distribution and consumption, preserved to extend life of the product by preventing contamination from things such as air and bacteria. </p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item">    <p> And packaging design is used to communicate the brand or product on display, promote and draw attention and influence purchase decision and transact allowing buying and selling possibilities that can easily integrate with various systems. </p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item">    <p>Foreign signals, these signals directly affect your trust and is probably the most influential part of your perception. If you can relate to Pickwick as a brand, you are more likely to relate with its products as well. This includes: Pickwick’s Brand Identity (its name, trademark, communication, and visual appearance that allows you to recognize the original), Product name (in this case being “Tropical Fruit” to let you associate a meaning to the product), Product Message (photography of fruit, water elements, symbols, illustrations, typography) and Place of Origin ( in this case the text on the side which contains its cultural associations, and the assumptions of the product quality). </p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2">    <p>Structural signals, these signals are the physical characteristics of the product that you react to before consciously processing information about the product. The pink color of this packaging instantaneously evokes a response and conveys a meaning or message without words. The geometric box defining the form of its product or container which suggests potential use of the product. Material elements that define the surface can evoke your emotional response of the anticipated product experience.</p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height3">    <p>Basic signals, these signals determine the essential properties of the product to inform you to understand their purposes. Instructions (how you use the product), Ingredients (all the components and substances that the tea is made out of), Shelf-life (the period for which this tea is good to be consumed), and Volume (the quantity, in this case being 20 tea bags within one container).
</div>
  <div class="grid-item">    <p>Transactional signals, these signals provide you with information that helps you make your purchase decision. This includes the price which enables you to assess the value of the tea (is it worth it?), Promotion (2 for the price of 1) and the well known Barcode which is a universal product code that allows retailers to access information to complete transactions.
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2">    <p>Although the science probably goes far beyond just these four signals I’ve mentioned, you can already see that packaging design is an amazing form of design that almost instantly delivers an experience and is made to get your reaction. In the next chapter I discuss the psychology within packaging. In the next article we will discuss in detail how product packaging impacts our perceptions,
