 <h1>Will packaging retain its current form despite the digital evolution and rapid improvement of technology, and if so what would change?</h1>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="grid-item"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height2">    <p>In my thesis I analyze packaging and packaging design, more specifically if the next generation of packaging will be digital. This subject comes from my personal fascination of packaging design. As a graphic designer I believe packaging needs just as much attention as the product you are selling. This comes in many different forms. Modern day packaging have features which go beyond just the protection and conservation of products. It also includes features to communicate, promote and act. </p>
</div>
 <div class="grid-item grid-item--height4"><h2><strong>Chapter 1: The Information System.</strong></h2></div>
 
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3">    <p>Packaging supplies multiple signals to affect or perception and impact on consumer behavior. These functions are considered normal today, but it took many years to develop packaging to a carefully crafted object that merges multiple functions into a thin piece wrapped around products. Increasing competition and continuous technological innovations have formed the evolution of packaging since the 1860s.</p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2">    <p>Packaging is like a silent salesman for a product. In a supermarket, on the shelf, we as a costumers look at the product through its packaging and begin to form perceptions about the quality and its value to us. Successful packaging emotionally appeals to it’s target audience and allows them to imagine what they can do with the product. And if achieved, these emotions often convert into a decision of purchase, which is the main goal. I have come to understand that product packaging is carefully and precisely designed to go beyond its emotional appeal and to serve important functions critical to ensure that the product delivers a great experience before purchase.</p>
</div>
<img class="grid-item grid-item--width3" src="2.jpeg"</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width3">    <p>Some of the key functions are to protect, contain, preserve, communicate, promote and transact. The product is protected from physical damages caused from shock, vibration or compression during transportation, contained for efficiently and to define the amount of distribution and consumption, preserved to extend life of the product by preventing contamination from things such as air and bacteria. </p>

  <div class="grid-item">    <p> And packaging design is used to communicate the brand or product on display, promote and draw attention and influence purchase decision and transact allowing buying and selling possibilities that can easily integrate with various systems. </p>
</div>

  <div class="grid-item">  <p><b>Foreign signals,</b> these signals directly affect your trust and is probably the most influential part of your perception. If you can relate to Pickwick as a brand, you are more likely to relate with its products as well. This includes: Pickwick’s Brand Identity (its name, trademark, communication, and visual appearance that allows you to recognize the original), Product name (in this case being “Tropical Fruit” to let you associate a meaning to the product), Product Message (photography of fruit, water elements, symbols, illustrations, typography) and Place of Origin ( in this case the text on the side which contains its cultural associations, and the assumptions of the product quality). </p>
</div>

<img class="grid-item grid-item--width3" src="1.png"</div>

  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2">    <p><b>Structural signals</b>, these signals are the physical characteristics of the product that you react to before consciously processing information about the product. The pink color of this packaging instantaneously evokes a response and conveys a meaning or message without words. The geometric box defining the form of its product or container which suggests potential use of the product. Material elements that define the surface can evoke your emotional response of the anticipated product experience.</p>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height3"> <p><b>Basic signals</b>, these signals determine the essential properties of the product to inform you to understand their purposes. Instructions (how you use the product), Ingredients (all the components and substances that the tea is made out of), Shelf-life (the period for which this tea is good to be consumed), and Volume (the quantity, in this case being 20 tea bags within one container).
</div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p><b>Transactional signals</b>, these signals provide you with information that helps you make your purchase decision. This includes the price which enables you to assess the value of the tea (is it worth it?), Promotion (2 for the price of 1) and the well known Barcode which is a universal product code that allows retailers to access information to complete transactions.
</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>Although the science probably goes far beyond just these four signals I’ve mentioned, you can already see that packaging design is an amazing form of design that almost instantly delivers an experience and is made to get your reaction. In the next chapter I discuss the psychology within packaging. In the next article we will discuss in detail how product packaging impacts our perceptions. </p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height4"><h2><strong >Chapter 2: Our perceptions.  </strong></h2></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2"><h3><i>‘Consumer buying behavior can be defined as a series of activities people engage in when searching, evaluating, selecting, purchasing, using and disposing of products and services so as to satisfy their needs and desires.’</i></h3></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p>In a store, the packaging acts as a gateway to a product. You look at a product thru its packaging and react to how it makes you feel at that moment. If you feel the product can satisfy your needs, it influences your buying behavior. This ‘feeling’ is a result of choices made across numerous stages. By analyzing buying behavior in detail, I can highlight the role of packaging throughout it. </p></div>
  
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--footnote"><p>  Consumer Behaviors and Target Audience Decisions, Integrated Marketing Communications, chapter 3</p></div>
  
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>The typical buying behavior can be analyzed based on Ian Pavlov’s conditioning theory.   We can see the consumer in as a subject who gets exposed to a product on the shelf in it’s packaging, as the stimuli. The stimuli in this case had been carefully designed to affect our response and achieve a desired consumer behavior. This suggests that the packaging is a direct influence on our perception of the product. And so the perception of the product is created to affecting our buying decision.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p><i>Perceived value may be seen as an “overall assessment of the utility of a product based on perceptions of what they receive (quality) versus what they give (price)”. </i></i></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p>Making a decision to buy a product, makes us as customers go through various mental stages before we make a choice. Whenever we identify a need, you begin to actively look around and take-in information and based on what will be presented during these stages, we form an attitude towards a certain product. Finally, after a selection is made, and we decide to buy, we continue to evaluate this decision, while enjoying the product experience. </p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3"><p>However, often we get input from our family, friends, colleagues, reviews on online forums, and several other sources. Each of these inputs serve as a signal that affects our attitude and perception towards the product.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>But filtering information to find the right signals is difficult and it is even harder to retain this information, so when exposed to conflicting signals, consumers can get confused and will tend to show impulsive buying behavior. Under such circumstances, they rely on the product packaging to provide visceral signals, as discussed in chapter one, which enables to skip through several decision making stages. </p></div>

  <div class="grid-item grid-item--footnote"><p>  Perceived value,  Consumer Perceptions of Price, Quality and Value: A Means-End Model and Synthesis Evidence; by Valarie A Zeithaml, 1988.</p></div>
  
  <div class="grid-item"><p><b>Is the price of this tea worth it?</b> We directly link price with quality. Most of us expect products with a high price to offer a higher quality experience over other that are cheaper.  During this decision making process we unintentionally search for signals to validate our own expectations. If we spent time in validation and available signals display a better quality, and so we often create emotional ties based on a specific design choice. </p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p>Example: When the price of a tea brand is very high, we get very cautious. This explains why we are careful when buying gifts, or planning for a special occasion. We are willing to spend time, involving ourselves into the process and ensuring we choose the best, under given circumstances.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>Our involvement is influenced to our personal, psychological, and social contexts, hence the extent of our pursuit can’t be determined but our willingness to engage is certain.</p></div>
  
 <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height2"><p>When the price a tea brand is low, we tend to take impulsive decisions. This explains why over 70% purchases in supermarkets are unplanned. Although, we appear to skip most stages during impulsive buying, psychologically we are responding to the instinctive signals from product packaging in many cases and are making instant judgments about product quality. The importance of these signals in shaping purchase decision can be assumed from the fact that every 9 out of 10 consumers prefer in-store purchase when 5 of them had already researched online. </p></div>

  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height4"><h2><strong >Chapter 3: Historic developments.</strong></h2></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3"><p>We won’t ever know for sure, but it seems logical that ages ago food was made and consumed at the spot, so there was no need for packaging. As we grew and evolved, the need to protect, transport and hold food was probably important. The earliest forms of packaging would have been containers made of natural material such as tree leaves, bamboo and animal skin. This is even still being often used in underdeveloped countries. Good examples of these are the Japanese tea baskets made oud of stray and clay. The use of new materials must have started with the the discovery of minerals and chemicals.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>The beginning of an Industrial Revolution started with the use of engines and created demands for more production. A remarkable number of packaging innovations such as molten glass, cardboard boxes, metal cans and cellophane where all created during WWI. </p></div>
  
   <div class="grid-item grid-item--footnote"><p>  Erik Sass, Technological Advancements of World War I, http://mentalfloss.com/article/31882/12-technological-advancements-world-war-i, August 2016</p></div>
  
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width3"><p>A rise of the supermarket culture dramatically changed distribution and consumption worldwide. This behavior of “self-service” called for packaging to take on the role of a silent salesman, as explained in the first chapter. Fast forward to the 20th century, with the rise of digital technology. Companies have become global en grow rapidly each day. With absolutely no competition, package is the way to present products on the shelf. But as much as it has become essential for companies, it is also recognized as a threat to environment, Plastic pollution.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p>Research continues not just to find new materials, but also to find the best sustainable solutions.
In just the last few decades, advances in personal computing, and mobiles have significantly transformed consumer behavior and thus their expectations. With access to unlimited information every time, every where, we value engaging experiences. Since the creation and use of barcodes, many digital technologies have continually been tested to improve experiences. With the rise of the infinite “Internet of Things” , together with advances in mobile computing, RFID , AR  and Biosensors , we are at the point where digital experiences may position product packaging as Emotional Selling Point.</p></div>

 <div class="grid-item grid-item--footnote"><p>Internet of things, a proposed development of the Internet in which everyday objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data.
  RFID, Radio-frequency identification, the use of electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects
  AR, Augmented reality, a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data.
  Biosensor, an analytical device, used for the detection of a substance, that combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector.
</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item"><p>This short summary of historical development within packaging shows a lot of patterns across the decades. To better understand these patterns, in the next chapter, I dive deeper into specific innovations that helped shaped packaging as it is now. It is interesting to see how the innovations, while trying to please the consumer needs, most of the time help shape consumer behavior too</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height4"><h2><strong>Chapter 4:  Shaping behavior</strong></h2></div>
  
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height3"><h3>“Caveat emptor”  became popular phrase since products were being faked and sold to uninformed customers. Original manufacturers began to mark their product with their identification to alert potential buyers. However not sufficient, manufacturers turned to use packaging in innovative ways to establish their brand identity.</h3></div>
  
   <div class="grid-item grid-item--footnote"><p>  Caveat emptor, (Let the buyer beware) the contract law principle that controls the sales of other goods.</p></div>

  
  <div class="grid-item"><p>An example of this is the biscuit package by a brand called ‘Uneeda’. I found that this is often referred to as the birth of consumer packages for its widespread distribution and the effects that their folding cartons had on businesses ever since. Apparently in 1896, 1 million US dollars was invested in creating a brand identity for 'Uneeda Biscuits' to take over its rival ‘Cracker Jacks’. </p></div>
  <img class="grid-item grid-item--width3" src="6.jpeg"</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>The biscuits were wrapped in waxed paper within a paper carton, and a brand printed wrap characterized by a boy in a raincoat, to emphasize the barrier of moisture barrier. The carton packaging also represented the power of brand advertising that relied on packaging as a sales tool tied to an easily recognizable identity advertised in magazines, and on billboards.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height2"><p>The shape can be an Identity. We all know Coca Cola, its icon logo and the bottle shape. It is one of the most recognizable images in the world today. Their brand developed thru time and thru multiple different variations of shapes. The very first unique bottle design by Coca Cola was said to been introduced in 1916. In early 1900s the company found that the regular straight bottle being used at the time wasn't distinctive enough and that it was easily becoming confused with ‘copycat’ brands. Thus they approached glass manufacturers to come up with a unique bottle designs which was approved in 1915.  The new bottle shape was the beginning of a unique branded bottle shape we came to know today. </p></div>

  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2"><p><i>An interesting term I stumbled upon while researching historical developments in packaging was ‘dual use’. Dual use was the first sign of intentional designed multi-functioning packaging. </i></p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p>The example that is given of ‘dual use’ is of a tobacco tin by the name ‘Dixie Queens’ made in the late 1800s. Tobacco back then came in big metal tins and this was the first one who was designed to be re-usable. It has two handles and a nice lithographed design pattern to resemble a picnic basket so the consumer could use it as a basket after use. One could argue that this was the beginning of multi functioning within packaging design. An example relating this to tea is the ‘vacuum flask’, designed to keep the tea you put in it hot or cold.</p></div>

   <img class="grid-item grid-item--width4" src="5.jpeg"</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>You can now print on anything. Most packaging used typographic treatments to create a visual identity. Due to limitations of letterpress printing, product packaging could only be embraced with illustrative painted imagery to define the contents, it was not truly an interpretation or an honest impression of the product’s content. It was after the invention of aniline printing technology, that packaging materials afforded visual information with a higher degree of precision, reproducing impressions of actual realistically. The aniline printing used dye on rubber blocks and the technique allowed printing on any kind of substrate including boards, milk cartons, paper bags, folding cartons and metallic films. This technique is now known as Flexography , and is the default for package printing. An example of this method in use, are the plastic bottles or metal cans of most ice tea products.</p></div>
   <img class="grid-item grid-item--height2" src="9.jpeg"</div>
   

  <div class="grid-item"><p>Everything has become convenient. ‘Swanson’  introduced TV Dinners that offered busy people, the conveniences of pre-made food requiring minimal preparation. The original tray was made of aluminum, cut into three neat compartments for frozen products. The frozen dinner can be heated in an oven and are easily digestible. Even now pre-made food is still a trend and being sold in our beloved Albert Heijn. The boiling of water for your tea is also becoming more convenient as we speak. In modern-day society, a water boil is not even needed anymore. The invention of having instant boiled clean tap water is something that is currently trending in the Netherlands.</p></div>
   <img class="grid-item grid-item--width3" src="7.jpeg"</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3"><p>Japanese packaging is one of the front-runners of innovative packaging design. To know more about their way of working I visited “Too pretty to throw away”, an exhibition at Sieboldhuis.   As a self proclaimed “Japanese graphic design fan” the exhibition in Leiden was a must visit. “Too pretty to throw away” had an interesting premise: The show questions the general assumption that modern day Japanese packaging is rooted in pre-modern Japanese artistic traditions. The Japanese packaging industry cleverly taps into the artistic traditions of the past and creatively merges them with the diversity of the present. This is achieved through retro designs, which add an exclusive and nostalgic appeal to the products they decorate. Japan is a country of inspiring opposites: old traditions versus high tech modern culture, pure minimalism versus intricate decorative styles, all could be found at this exhibition. The show was divided into three parts: the first revolves around the older artistic traditions, the second part <i>“The Alchemy of Everyday”</i> and the last one explains how to interpret the layers of embellishment.</p></div>
     <img class="grid-item grid-item--height2" src="11.jpg"</div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>When I entered the exhibition on the top floor, the dimly lit room welcomed you with a mix of 19th Century pieces on loan from Museum Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology, Leiden). There were lots of sake bottles, some ceramics, stationery sets, woodblock prints and even a portable picnic set.
The second part showed the influence of foreign technology. Reusable items such as ceramics are replaced by disposable glass and plastics. For example, the Ozeki One Cup sake is a modern design classic that can be found in vending machines and “konbini” (convenient stores) around Japan. Its introduction in 1964 changed the way people consumed rice wine, as it was now available smaller bottle sizes, making it more convenient for parties, picnics or on trains. The selection “The alchemy of everyday” carried a great amount of award winning packaging design courtesy of JPDA (Japan Package Design Association), including beautiful Onigiri (rice ball) packs for Lawson, well considered shampoo bottle designs for Shiseido and very Japanese, minimalistic Warew cosmetics range by Nosigner. The final space was reserved for the craft and consideration that goes into giving presents. Stores cater to this tradition, which make up a fair share of the nations economy. Presentation is key when it comes to gifts. When you buy a gift in shop in Japan they wrap it in such a beautiful way and at least double-bag it. All these layers of paper, ribbons, cords, even the paper bag make it become quite ceremonial. The added embellishments emphasize the intention of the gift giver towards its receiver.
</p></div>
     <img class="grid-item grid-item--height3" src="12.jpg"</div>
 <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height2"><p>It was quite remarkable to see that Mitsukoshi’s wrapping paper looks brand new, but turns out to be from 1950. The same thing can be said about the magazine cover illustrations by Hisui Sugiura from 1913–1914, that wouldn’t look out of place today. Hisui Sugiura, seen as the pioneer of modern Japanese graphic design, was responsible for the Mitsukoshi identity between 1910 and 1934. This visit made me realize that it is important to know the history of products in order to know what the future might bring.</p></div>

 <div class="grid-item grid-item--height4"><h2><strong>Chapter 5: Digital Rise & Utopias</strong></h2></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3"><p>Digital printing technologies, coupled with innovative transactional capabilities has provided an unprecedented speed of execution. While the growing fascination with plastics lead to innovation in packaging shapes and materials, it meant other materials like paper and glass found themselves limited in its use for packaging. This widespread adoption of plastics paved way for use-and-throw behavior, and non-decomposable packaging waste became primary part of land filled with garbage as a result.
Finding sustainable materials and optimizing waste became a main importance, heavily influencing the package design. Now, it is almost necessary to reduce the amount of packaging for products not just for its financial benefits, but the emotional connect it offers for consumers making them feel good
about their choice.
</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>As far as I can remember barcodes have existed before I was born and are the universal way of purchasing a product. The oldest commercial U.P.C. scanner I came across during my research was said to be installed in 1974 at a supermarket in Ohio, America. The first product to have a bar code included on its packaging was a pack of gum by a company named Wrigley’s. Fast forward to now, barcodes have become the standard checkout processing and retailing have revolutionized. While barcodes supermarkets made a convenient place to stay, they also hastened the demise of public markets and independent supermarkets. </p></div>

  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width3"><p>In the early 1980s, Adobe, Aldus, Apple, and Hewlett-Packard each produced key technologies that allowed professional desktop publishing to overtake package printing. Owing to the benefits of identical and easy duplication, digital printing presses started to take over traditional printing methods by late 1980s. With the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, the smartphones rapidly grew to become a major force and became part of consumer’s shopping behavior. Now a days, consumers use their devices to get product information, compare options and deals, and also to place orders and track post purchase behaviors. The explosion of ‘experience’ happened after Steve Jobs released iPhone in 2007. It became an instant hit and in a few years consumers started expecting more and more from all kinds of products. The interaction of your mobile phone with packaging in the supermarket is already exciting. A pack of tea could have a QR code on it’s package which allows you to interact it with your mobile phone.</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item"><p>During BNO’s Super Fast #3   There was a presentation given by Leonie van Tienen. The presentation included her research in offline and online packaging. Van Tienen started with the research question: <i>“Which packaging design elements have an effect on the purchase intention of shoppers in an online retail environment?”.</i> By researching different aspects of this subject (color attractiveness, packaging shape, size of the brand name and quantity size) she was able to come to a conclusion. She did her measurable research working with an online survey. Van Tienen came to the conclusion that color coding online was of main importance, and product form has a lesser impact online. However, interesting the research might have been, Van Tienen only did this research using images of produced packaging. If an offline product where to be translated online, one could argue that a digital design would improve the results of interaction, hence influencing a purchase intention.</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item"><p>In a world where everything is rapidly changing, from the way you brush your teeth to the fastenings of your shoes, food packaging has stayed more or less the same. The tea boxes might have gotten a bit fancier and pricey organic tea comes in marginally more environmentally friendly materials now (less packaging), but on the whole food has been left far behind the crowd in terms of progression in within this digital rise. And so our buying behavior more or less stays the same. In the next chapter I aim to discuss the potential change digital packaging might bring. What are our utopias and what is it that we actually want? And what will be the consequences these changes might make?</p></div>
  
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>During BNO’s Super Fast 2016 there was also a presentation given by Graham Sturt (Creative Director at VBAT ). Graham talked about the potential future of packaging. According to Graham the next generation (generation Y&Z), more specific the millennials  will determine the future of product packaging design. The mindset of a newer generations being a direct response to what is happening at this moment. This theory is interesting as it allows me to create several utopias based on the wishes and mindset of millenials together with innovations that are popular as of writing this thesis.</p></div>
  
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height3"><p>The upcoming generation of millennials is talking openly on social media (whether on Facebook, YouTube, or with friends, parents, and colleagues) about the struggles of being an adult. The result is a wave of cultural discussion around “adulting” and a surge of behavior that rebels against that very notion: “kidulting.” Unafraid to cut loose and stepping away from adult responsibilities, millennial consumers are looking for fun-focused experiences from childhood, and brands are taking notice. There already is enough proof of this notion, Camp Grounded (Summer camp for adults) brings the joys of summer camp back to adults , Nintendo has reintroduced its classic NES console with all the old nostalgic games of the 90s , Netflix has revived cult TV shows like Full House and Gilmore Girls.  In terms of graphic design we could see more and more tea packaging design using this notion. For example reusing ancient Chinese way of presenting tea in wooden cups. Turning back to earthly materials within packaging might become the next utopia. </p></div>
  
  <div class="grid-item"><p>Tomorrow Machine, a Swedish product design studio is already working towards this idea. Their ideas are so innovative that it’s almost difficult to believe they’re real. Tomorrow Machine created packaging which dissolves just as the food it contains, plant pots that eliminate the need for watering, self-cleaning plates that actually work, and food packaging that opens in the oven when the food inside it is ready to eat.</p></div>

    <div class="grid-item"><p>By using a meticulous understanding of science, a desire for sustainability and an equally impressive aesthetic, this might be the next way of designing. 
As people seek personal enrichment beyond the worlds of work, social media, and city life, an overwhelming number are escaping to the great outdoors with apps like AllTrails that make the world more accessible. We can expect to see more companies connect their strategic bottom line to doing good for the environment. Tentree and Tinlid have already taken note, planting trees for every product they sell.</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>AR and VR are crossing the digital boundary and becoming a physical experience. With the success of Pokémon Go, we can assume that more brands will merge offline with online, creating packaging that put virtual experiences into the real world by for example looking thru your mobile phone. Home improvement, furniture, and fashion brands will all capitalize on this technology to give shoppers a preview of how their purchases will look in real life. Imagine a brand of tea that tells the story of how it was made with moving visuals thru the augmented reality. Virtual reality will then even go beyond the consumer. Areas like healthcare, manufacturing, education, and even law will use VR to make more informed choices and increase efficiency. Manufacturing companies will use VR to understand their supply stream, remotely walking through a factory to visualize costs and pain points.

  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height2"><p>Companies will use the convergence of messaging platforms, chatbots and increasingly powerful AI across industries to create friendly interactions between man and machine. Instead of a logo and a website, the tone and personality of the bot will create the designed brand experience. MasterCard recently launched Kai, a bot for banks. I could easily see corporations using this method to sell their product by giving information thru the use of chatbots. I can easily see the possibility of a chatbot with whom you can react with to ask: “What is the best way to preserve my used tea bag?”</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2"><p>The world’s leading brands and small businesses will connect with consumers in new ways by creating customized in-store experiences using elements like music, scent, digital signage, and even pathways through the store. Abercrombie & Fitch recently changed its music, upped its lighting, reduced its scent, and de-cluttered its stores to meet customer preferences. Brands will look to make mood marketing an art form, triggering positive responses and creating unique buying experiences for their target audiences.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p>Young urban creatives are influencing packaging design more and more. But for this 20-something city dweller, less might actually be more again with brands adapting to fit their style. Whether it’s packaging, colors, graphics, or logos, simple might just get even simpler. The brand ‘Kashi’ recently redesigned its packaging using a very minimal color palette and design to counter act the already busy visuals in the store. In a chaotic, technologically advanced world, easy-to-find packaging with clear messaging will help customers make decisions and find relief from busy shelves, not changing implementing busy layers.
Food will be all about balance. Consumers won’t be afraid of the occasional indulgence while still focusing on maintaining healthy baselines. McDonald’s tapped into this with the Mac Jr., and Mars Foods has labeled some of its items as fit only for ‘occasional’ consumption.

   <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2 grid-item--height2"><p>One of the biggest challenges for coming years is the shortage of food and water due to the growing global population and rising prosperity. The extreme weather conditions caused by climate change make harvests changeable and unpredictable. Packaging plays a crucial role in preventing food waste. Food is transported over long distances and must stay fresh longer than previously. A new generation of RFID makes it possible to monitor the quality of primary products in real time. Packaging also contributes to the efficient use of food. The online economy has changed the role of packaging. Seducing consumers and providing product information happens online. The aesthetics of the packaging only plays a role once the customer unpacks the delivered product.</p></div>
 <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3"><p>In the local economy, the emphasis is on recycling. Waste is processed locally as much as possible, for example by composting. Packaging is either reusable or biodegradable. Because packaging has the reputation of being wasteful, many producers avoid using it. Supermarkets have switched to ‘self-dispensing’ and electronics are delivered in special cases that are then taken away again by the manufacturer. Innovation in materials is mainly focused on adapting various raw materials for use as packaging that is afterwards biodegradable. Use of materials is highly dependent on local availability, with big variations between regions.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height3"><p>The European circular economy is a reality. Packaging has much the same function as before. However, in design much more account is taken of reuse and recyclability. Such designs do not always match neatly with consumer perceptions. The use of ‘single material' packaging is standard. The lease economy has significantly reduced the use of packaging. Thanks to modular-based products, components can be easily reused. The availability of almost-free electricity means food can be frozen immediately after production and kept frozen until the moment of consumption. Making the use of protective packaging largely superfluous.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--height2"><p>The breakthrough of the 3D printer has fundamentally changed supply chains. Consumers have become ‘prosumers’, and production takes place on a very small scale in or close to people's homes. Transportation is limited to the transport of raw materials for the 3D printer. Food is partly printed and partly grown by people themselves in climate-controlled mini-greenhouses. Thanks to technology, households are almost totally self-sufficient. Packaging is hardly necessary. In this scenario, the 3D printer becomes a metaphor for 'disruptive technology', which also includes the ‘smart computer’ and 'self-steering car’.</p></div>
<div class="grid-item grid-item--height4"><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2></div>
<div class="grid-item grid-item--height4"><h2><strong>The starting point of this thesis was a personal fascination of mine, and my curiosity towards the potential future of packaging. Through this research I came to know about de numerous innovations thru the years that played an important role in how we use packaging today. I also learned about how product packaging influences our way of perceiving, as well as innovation excising out of consumer need. From the inventions of now fundamental materials such as glass, paper and metal to more recent inventions such as 3D printing, it is definite that every big revolution in packaging changes the way we consume and reflects on our society.</h2></div>
<div class="grid-item grid-item--height4"><h2><strong>In the beginning of my thesis I was sure that the implementing of futuristic digital displays, like the cereal box in the Sci-Fi film ‘Minority Report’ was going to take place sooner or later. I saw no reason other than expense for not having cool displays on product packaging in the shelves of supermarkets. But after researching current innovations and the way we think about consuming now, I came to understand that packaging will not have fancy digital displays to capture your attention and influence costumer interest, but will more and more lean towards environment friendly innovation and multifunctional consumer friendly use.  So packaging will, in a way, retain its current form by serving the main fundamentals instead of evolving into a digital piece of technology. However packaging will evolve into having more multifunctioning properties that will serve consumer needs. What these new properties exactly will be is impossible to tell as technology is growing in a rapid pace.</h2></div>
